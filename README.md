# Tracking of unmarked bees in 2D 
This repository contains code for trajectory matching of unmarked honeybees in 2D descibed in the manuscript [Markerless tracking of an insect colony at a single organism resolution](). The notebook `track_demo` will walk you through the following steps of the analysis. Sample images and videos used in this notebook are included in the `sample_data` folder. Other data necessary to run the notebook can be downloaded [here](https://beepositions.unit.oist.jp/track_sample_data.zip).
